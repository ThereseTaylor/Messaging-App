### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**: Ensure that Python is installed on your system.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ThereseTaylor/Messaging-App.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash

   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *Note: If `requirements.txt` is not provided, ensure that the `socket` and `threading` modules are available in your Python environment.*

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Server**:

   ```python
   python server.py
   ```

   *The server will start and listen for incoming connections on `PORT` (default: 3389).*

2. **Start the Client**:

   In a separate terminal or on a different machine, run:

   ```python
   python client.py
   ```

   *You can start multiple clients to simulate different users.*

## ðŸ“„ Code Overview

### Client Code Highlights

The client script connects to the server, sends and receives messages, and has a user-friendly GUI built using Tkinter.

```python
# Example code snippet from the client
client = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
client.connect(('SERVER_HOST', 3389))
# Starts a new thread to listen for incoming messages
threading.Thread(target=listen_for_messages_from_server, args=(client,)).start()
```

### Server Code Highlights

The server script is a multithreaded application that handles multiple clients simultaneously, broadcasting messages to all connected clients.

```python
# Example code snippet from the server
server = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
server.bind((HOST, PORT))
server.listen(LISTENER_LIMIT)
# Accepts and handles new clients in a separate thread
threading.Thread(target=client_handler, args=(client,)).start()
```
